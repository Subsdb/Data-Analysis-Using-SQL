StackOverflow Annual Developer Survey

This is an end-to-end SQL project where I have extracted data from StackOverflow website and did Data Analysis to get some insights on the data which helped me to answer the below questions 
-- Q1. Are you more likely to get a job as a developer if you only have a Bachelor's degree?
-- Q2 . How much does remote working matter to employees?
-- Q3. Which online learning platform is most popular to learn how to code?
-- Q4. Which job role is paying more salary in India?
-- Q5 . How frequently do people who are just learning how to code visit StackOverflow ?
